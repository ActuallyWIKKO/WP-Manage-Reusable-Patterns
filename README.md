# WP-Manage-Reusable-Patterns
When testing the latest Wordpress nightly release I found something bugging me: The devs made a way to have resuable patterns for the Gutenberg Editor but they totally missed making the management of these new patterns easily accessable.

This plugin solves that design flaw and it adds a submenu, that lets you easily access the Manage Reusable Patterns page of the Gutenberg editor.
This plugin was created for Wordpress 6.4 Alpha and above.

# Usage:
Copy the file to a new folder in your installation in the following path /wp-content/plugins and activate it in the admin backend. Find and manage the resuable patterns in the Appearance menu in the admin backend of Wordpress.
